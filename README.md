Belly Button Biodiversity challenge

Using data from https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/

Work in progress - code is in Starter Code folder, index.html, and the app is at startercode/static/js/app.js.

Need to figure out how to deploy the app to the github page and create a link.
