Belly Button Biodiversity challenge

Using data from https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/

Work in progress - code is in Starter Code folder, index.html, and the app is at startercode/static/js/app.js.

Link to deployed project is here - https://elzackogrande.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

But it is not pulling through, though when I open it from my folder on my computer it works just fine. Not sure why this is happening.
